# Different Pig game
Pig is a simple dice game that can be played by two people.   

 Rules of the game:
* "Player 1" starts the game and repeatedly presses the Dice button (rolls the dice).   
* The game goes on until the rolled dice is 1 or "Player 1" presses the Hold button.  
* If the dice rolled is 1, your set score is zero and it's the next player's turn.  
* But if you press the Hold button, your Set Score will be added to the total score of the game and then it's the next player's turn.  
* â€‹The game continues until a player's score reaches 100.
